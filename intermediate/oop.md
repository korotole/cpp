# Classes

**Class**:
- is a *mathematical* set of all potential beings connected together through precisely defined similarities.
- is a set of objects.
- each *subclass* is more specialized than its *superclass*.

**Object**:
- is a being belonging to the class
- *name*, *properties*, *abilities*

**Inheritance**:
- Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy inherits all the traits defined inside any of the superclasses.

`class A {}; A a;`

Defined class becomes an *equivalent of a type*, can be used as a *typename*.
